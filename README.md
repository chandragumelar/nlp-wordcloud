# Project Overview
This project aims to generate a wordcloud visualization based on a CSV 
file containing descriptions of individuals' historical significance. By 
analyzing the text data, the project extracts the most common words used 
to describe these individuals and presents them in a visually appealing 
simple wordcloud format
